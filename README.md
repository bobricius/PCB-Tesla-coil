# PCB-Tesla-coil
Simple Open PCB Tesla coil

Very easy Tesla Coil ... 3 components only = LED, BD243 transistor and 82K resistor

Hackday is my daily inspiration, every day found something interesting like this
http://www.megavolts.nl/en/projecten/tesla-spoelen/201-pcb-spiral-teslacoil
It is nice project but very complicated.

I have no idea how exactly tesla coil work, but I try glue all my knowledge and almost all is just experiments try and mistake ... 

But this project is much more easy and opensource (soon),
effectivity is far away from original.
Everybody can improve it ...
